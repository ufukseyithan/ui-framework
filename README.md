# UI Framework
A small framework which helps creating UIs for [CS2D](http://www.cs2d.com/). It is a lot easier to create buttons, texts, images and subsequently interacting with them in matters of styles and events.

## Installation
The installation is quite easy. Create a folder in your `sys/lua` and name it (preferably) "ui-framework" (if you name it differently, you will have to change *paths.sys* in `main.lua` accordingly), and then put all the files into there. Lastly, extract [the required asset .rar file](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1Grh3Zve3MhMk88av-ni58FS5KQqBDeLd) into your CS2D folder.

To get the use of the framework, simply dofile `main.lua` and you are ready to start creating your custom UIs.

## Features

### Objects
You can create objects such as buttons, texts, images and even windows only with a single function. Every function which creates an object, returns objectâ€™s data (sort of an ID), meaning you can save their data to variables, and later use them to change their properties or even tie new events to them.
```Lua
local object = ui.objects.createImage(id, path, x, y, style)
```

Create a Button object whose background will be auto-sized by its text width (has padding 10):
```Lua
local button = ui.objects.createButton(id, "Button", x, y, true, 10, {
    background = {
        color = {155, 155, 155},
        alpha = 0.5
    }
})
```
In order this to work, *textwidthLibrary* in `config.lua` should be set to true (default). 

### Styles
Objects may have a style changing their visual look. Defining properties such as color, background, alpha in so-called "patterns" (tables) and then tying them to the objects in certain ways accomplishes it.

Create a style pattern which would make images red when tied:
```Lua
ui.style.new("red", {
    color = {0, 255, 0}
})
```

Create an Image object whose color is red:
```Lua
local object = ui.objects.createImage(id, path, x, y, {
    color = {255, 0, 0}
})
```
Or:
```Lua
local object = ui.objects.createImage(id, path, x, y, "red")
```
Or:
```Lua
object.setStyle("red")
```

Create a Text object that has auto-sized background:
```Lua
local text = ui.objects.createText(id, "Text", x, y, nil, nil, {
    background = {
        color = {155, 155, 155},
        alpha = 0.5,
        padding = 5
    }
})
```
In order this to work, *textwidthLibrary* in `config.lua` should be set to true (default). 

### Events
Objects are not composed of styles, you can likewise specify what to happen when clicking or hovering on them.
```Lua
-- The button becomes red when clicked
local button = ui.objects.createButton(id, "Click", x, y, 32, 32)
button.onClick = function()
    button.setStyle({
        textColor = "255000000"
    })
end
 ```
### Misc
The framework includes several functions that may help you while creating UIs. Such as getting player's mouse position, converting a dimension so it'll fit to the player's screen and so on.
