# UI Framework
UI Framework, as its name signifies, is a framework which assists you creating UIs with a small structure logic for a game called [CS2D](http://www.cs2d.com/). It is a lot easier to create buttons, texts, images and subsequently interacting with them now.

## Installation
The installation is quite easy. Just create a new folder in `sys/lua/` called "ui-framework" and put all the files in there. Dofile the `main.lua` and you're good to go! Although you can name the folder you are going to create like however you want, as long as you change the value of `ui.path` in `main.lua`.

## Features

### Objects
You can create objects such as buttons, texts, images and even windows only with a single function. Every function that is to create an object, returns objectâ€™s data (sort of an ID). This implies you can save their data to variables, and then use them to change their properties or even tie new events to them.
```Lua
local object = ui.objects.createImage(id, path, x, y, style)
```
### Styles
Every object may have a style defining their visual look. The size or the colour of a text, the opacity or the scale of an image; those are all very effortless to change now. Having an extra table with all the style information in it as usually a last parameter when creating an object, makes it happen. Moreover, you can even create style patterns and use them on specific objects. 
```Lua
--setting a style right after creating an object
local object2 = ui.objects.createImage(id, path, x, y, {
    color = {255, 0, 0}
})

--creating a pattern
ui.style.new("red", {
    color = {255, 0, 0}
})

--using the pattern on an object
object.setStyle("red")
 ```

### Events
Objects are not composed of styles, you can likewise specify what to happen when clicking or hovering on them.
```Lua
--the button turns red when clicked
local button = ui.objects.createButton(id, "Click", x, y, 32, 32, style)
button.onClick = function()
    button.setStyle({
        textColor = "255000000"
    })
end
 ```
### Misc
The framework includes several functions that may help you while creating UIs. Such as getting player's mouse position, converting a dimension so it'll fit to the player's screen and so on.
